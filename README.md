Rotten USA Tomatoes -- a mobile web app mashup with USA TODAY movie reviews and the RottenTomatoes.com API.  Won the 2nd place Mashery.com award at MoDevEast Hackathon 2012.

More of a proof of concept than anything else.

Built using HTML5, JavaScript/AJAX/jQuery, SASS, and Ratchet.  And panic (the emotion, not the software company).
